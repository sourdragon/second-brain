## About the elephant in the room
### Statements that are true 
- She does add value to your life...
- You are hopelessly diseased and cant stop thinking about her at times. (or can I? maybe i can stop) 

####  1. Hmm i do feel at times, she doesnt care for me like
- When she didnt try to talk to me at flag lounge at the first / second day.
- Like she never tries to open convesations "Fed up of it" she told today ðŸ’” ,but used to ðŸ’”, only slight ðŸ’”
- Today, she went to talk with the girls, another talk at lunch plan failure( wait hows that even related, her friends she talks, what's bothering you ) 
- And for some reason she doesnt show me marks and does to Adesh. doesnt make sense
- And she asks her doubts to adesh and one time adesh gave the doubt to me and she was like no let adesh answer? She told she feels more "comfortable" with adesh? Idk, maybe not this...
- And why the hell she doesnt want to play basketball with you?! doesnt make sense

### What are some instances that are opposite of the above
- She chats with me everyday...
- She felt i "ignored" her , probby cuz she cares for me?
- She wanted to have lunch with me?


But all thats just some random observations ig..

Ok anyway why do i care about whether she cares about me. ok but in the end, one of the few instances i actually cared about a person. usually feelingless. Dam these feelings.

You know what , fug it . i do ~~not~~ care, enough caring. Lets just see what happens. 

#### 2. I get sad feelings about leaving her and the little time i have
- You should be more worried about family time.
- But its fine , i dont think i will ever once more "miss" a person ever again. First time "feelings"...

Ok in the end what made me like sad today is... just overthinking but overthinking about...
- how we might become strangers in the future...
- about the entire leaving her part...and how it might just be a dry chat or something...

Ok nvm chill. dont overthink , future will see in future. Rn what do i want from her. Or what should i do ...

Wait what happen to the entire forget about crush thing!!!! Hmm going the entire opposite way so far... Ok just ask whether she likes me... and if yes ... wait why do i care if she says yes or no... 

You know what , just take love , and throw it out the window... (if only that was possible)
but its all in the mindset, you are not gopali lover now come on....

Mission Non Gopali Lover Phase 2? Phase 1 went from Non crush objective to love pretty fast...
