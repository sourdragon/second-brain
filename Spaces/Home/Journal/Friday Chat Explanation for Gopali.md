1. Firstly i mentioned that i find it very stressful to like someone. 
2. Then randomly i asked about how can you like "liking someone".
3. Then went into liking you after school , how i could make this a long time relationship
4. Then convo got redirected to how only 4 month(3 in reality)
5. Me was like long term relationship -> feeling

6. Then you accepted that you felt like meeting me in future. (i commented its so petty)
7. Then you asked random question about bus
8. Then i indirectly asked whether "Are we in a relationship" ...
9. I told i feel "I think i should be your bf" and how dumb that is, 
10. Then asked you of impact of me telling crush to you . You told you would feel bad whether or not you told you have a crush.
